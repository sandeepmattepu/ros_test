The explanation here shows how we did it. If your intention was to make us create a new node from scratch and make it print infinity sign, we did this as well you need to checkout \textit {arc-function-node} branch and launch \textbf {inf\_arc.launch}. Description of this task has made us confuse.}}{4}{section.2}

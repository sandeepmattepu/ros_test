# ESS - basic ROS test

This test should examine basic knowledge about **[ROS](http://www.ros.org)**. Please remove all errors within this package - even the ones which are not obvious. At least the two launch files (ros_test.launch and inf.launch) have to work. Additionally you have to solve the tasks written in the email. Some general points:

## ROS

ROS should be used in the **"kinetic"** version. In principle you can use any Linux as operating system, but **Ubuntu 16.04** is strongly recommended.

## source code

* Your code must be written in **C++**.
* Please pay attention to the **project guidelines** of our workgroup. (*should be attached to the same email*)

## version management

The results of your test should be send to us as a **git** repository. You can choose between uploading it to bitbucket, gitlab or github and give us (read) access or send it by email as zip-archive (containing the git repository).

We recommend using git from the start.

## documentation

We want to have a short documentation of your work. The following content is requested:

* Where did you make changes?
* What was your approach?
* How does your solution look like?

The documentation could be a text file (Markdown is allowed) or a **PDF** file. We will reject office documents (like docx, odt, ...). There is no guideline about the length of your documentation - it should be complete.
